# eCafeteria XXI

This application is part of the lab project for the course unit EAPLI. Parts of 
the application were developed to show specific approaches or techniques; as such, 
the overall application is not consistent in terms of design. for production ready 
code this would obvisously be a problem as we should strive for consistency. In 
this case, it is acceptable as the inconsistencies are meant to provide samples 
of different valid approaches.
